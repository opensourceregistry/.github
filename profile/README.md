# Welcome to OpenSource Registry

## Support the Open-Source Community

Our mission is to support the open-source community by providing a sustainable way for creators to earn revenue from their work. We believe that open-source software is a vital part of the technology ecosystem and we're committed to supporting it.

## How it works

We provide a platform for publishers to publish their packages and for commercial users to access them. By subscribing to our service, commercial users gain access to a wide range of high-quality open-source packages that they can use in their projects. 

On the other hand, hobbyists, students, and open-source developers can use the service freely.

A percentage of the revenue generated from access is returned to the creators of the packages based on the number of downloads they've had. This allows creators to continue to invest time and effort in maintaining and updating their packages, ensuring that the open-source community can continue to benefit from their work.

## Join us

If you're a publisher, we'd love to have you join our registry and share your work with the community. If you're a commercial user looking for high-quality open-source packages to use in your projects, we're here to help you find what you need.

Thank you for supporting open-source software and the OpenSource Registry!
